Concrete plan for analysis

their usual bm separates more, like four separate clusters

can maybe

paper is up to a week, ours is 3

excel file is a merger of lot of different datasets. All was then
intersected and clustered, and then found DE genes. Para did this.
Probably ordered on p-value.

See bm (excel) as the "blueprint" for what we expect from an HSC.

Concatenate gene list, see it as a signal, test for that signal's
presence in ours. Project culture onto BM cells?

Would be nice to integrate viable and EPCR. "In line with that people
have done".

Difference in read depth, normalise this?

"EPCR & Viable is a lousy way of naming" -- David Bryder, 2022

Suggestion: Total and immature cells.

\- project

\- merge EPCR+viable

\- when merged, compare with BM DEGs

HSC frequency in culture is low as well (and esp in BM/more mature
cells)

keep CC-EPCR cells for now

"read the paper and see if we get inspiration for what one can do"

get barcodes from the merged datasets

cluster, take "landmark" cells, the "center ones", a representative, etc
etc.

meeting on Tuesday \@10
